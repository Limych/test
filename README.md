## About

Hass.io allows anyone to create add-on repositories to share their add-ons for
Hass.io easily. This repository is one of those repositories, providing extra
Home Assistant add-ons for your Hass.io installation.

The primary goal of this project is to provide you (as a Hass.io /
Home Assistant user) with additional, high quality, add-ons that allow you to
take your automated home to the next level.

## Installation

Adding this add-ons repository to your Hass.io Home Assistant instance is
pretty easy. Follow [the official instructions][third-party-addons] on the
website of Home Assistant, and use the following URL:
